Their social behavior, small size and the novelty of being able to see a real penguin up-close mean they’re a great face for the family.

  "informational_blurb.lilcritters.box_turtle": "“Box turtles” is a term used for a few genera of small, terrestrial turtles native to North America and Asia. Characterized by a hinged bottom shell, which safely fits the turtle inside. Asian and North American box turtles both converged on adaptations and aren't closely related to one another. Many species are threatened by habitat fragmentation and non-native diseases.",
  "informational_blurb.lilcritters.box_turtle_0": "Box turtles like the Eastern have long lifespans, and a strong homing instinct. They don’t like to travel more than 2 miles away from their home territory, and if they’re moved, they hoof it back. Habitat fragmentation, especially when humans build busy roads through forests, is a huge threat to these turtles, who are too slow to dodge cars to get back home.",
  "informational_blurb.lilcritters.box_turtle_1": "All species of box turtle, including the desert box turtle, are threatened by harvest for the pet trade. Despite cute cartoons of rosy-cheeked turtles and depictions of happy herps in aquariums, they aren’t very good pets for children. Turtles and tortoises are easily stressed by being handled too often, and can live for over 40 years.",
  "informational_blurb.lilcritters.box_turtle_2": "All box turtles, including the Florida box turtle, are in the pond turtle family with sliders and other terrapins. However, they’re solidly terrestrial, with a tall shell that isn’t streamlined for swimming, and solid legs to get around on land. While they don’t swim often, box turtles sometimes dip in puddles (or, in captivity, in their water dishes) to stay cool.",
  "informational_blurb.lilcritters.box_turtle_3": "The black and yellow speckled Gulf Coast box turtle is the largest species, and can reach up to 8 inches (20cm) in shell length. Box turtles have a varied diet, and will eat almost anything they can catch - insects, grubs, frogs, and even fruit and berries.",
  "informational_blurb.lilcritters.box_turtle_4": "Three-toed box turtles live in habitats where summer heat can be brutal, and they conserve moisture and stay cool by burrowing into leaf litter and soft soil. They hybridize easily with other box turtles, and it’s yet to be seen how escapees from the pet trade will affect other native box turtle species.",
  "informational_blurb.lilcritters.box_turtle_5": "Ornate box turtles are a small box turtle species native to the midwest, central, and southwestern United States, as well as northern Mexico. They prefer to be in grasslands or shrublands rather than water, often relying on shrubs to escape heat and build nests. The most significant cause of their population’s decline is the growing agricultural trade in the Great Plains region.",
  "informational_blurb.lilcritters.box_turtle_6": "The Mexican box turtle is endemic to the north-eastern coastal subtropics of Mexico. Though very rarely seen in captivity due to bans of imports since the 80’s, they still face threats of illegal poaching, habitat loss, and car strikes.",
  "informational_blurb.lilcritters.box_turtle_7": "Yucatan box turtles are a subspecies endemic to the Yucatán state of Mexico. They  are often debated to be a subspecies of common box turtles. They are terrestrial and live in very humid tropical rainforests. Although not much research is being done, they are becoming increasingly elusive and local people worry their wild populations are dwindling.",
  "informational_blurb.lilcritters.box_turtle_8": "Little is known about these elusive spotted turtles, being that they are endemic to the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico and seemingly very skilled at hiding from visitors. However, these turtles are sometimes seen out and about during the monsoon season while searching for a mate! Although they are not well studied, it is known that species in this area are threatened by aridification, soil degradation, and deforestation.",
  "informational_blurb.lilcritters.box_turtle_9": "Coahuilan box turtles are a very rare species only found in Cuatro Ciénegas of Mexico. They spend over 90% of their life in the water. Like other box turtles they are omnivorous, though they mostly eat insects, fish, crustaceans and mushrooms. Unfortunately they are endangered due to habitat destruction for pumping up groundwater and water diversion for canals.",
  "informational_blurb.lilcritters.box_turtle_10": "Due to high demand for their meat, shells, or companionship as pets, this species is one of the most exploited species in Southeast Asia. A small population has successfully sought refuge from habitat loss by moving into storm drains, as observed in Brunei. Four subspecies have been recognized by science, although some speculate that there are up to four more.",

Their carapaces are some of the roundest of Asian box turtles and resemble conquistador helmets. Despite many protected efforts, they suffer from the pet trade, despite not thriving in captivity, and their habitat is being destroyed for coffee plantations and farmland. There are only an estimated 3,000 to 10,000 individuals left.",

Opossums are slow-moving and generally gentle, but eat mice, rats, and insects that can make people and pets sick. They don’t hurt cats, dogs or pet chickens, and don’t carry rabies, so they’re great neighbors! Unfortunately, they aren’t the smartest or fastest animal, and many are killed in collisions with cars.",

While they can take their own prey, like mice, rats and small insects and amphibians, they can also eat human garbage. They readily adapt to human settlements and come out at night to eat. Slow-moving possums can be killed by loose dogs, so please keep pets inside.",

While full-grown Southern white-eared possums can’t hang from their tail because they’re too heavy, they can use it to stay secure as they move through trees. Baby possums can use their tails to catch them from a fall when learning to climb.",
